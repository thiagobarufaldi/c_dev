1.  What would the expression

    	c = getchar() != EOF

    do?

    Answer: Nothing.

2.  Why must the variable used to hold getchar's return value be type int?
    Answer: Because characters are really small ints in C?

3.  What is the difference between the prefix and postfix forms of the ++ operator?
    Answer: The prefix will execute the sum before the next interation and the postfix after the next interation;

4.  (trick question) What would the expression

    	i = i++

    do?
    Answer: It will execute normally but nothing will happen, the value of i will remain unchanged since the addition is postfix.

5.  What is the definition of a string in C?
    Answer: An array of characters.
    
6.  (Advanced) What will the getline function from section 6.3 of the notes do if successive calls to getchar return the four values 'a', 'b', 'c', and EOF? 
Is getline's behavior reasonable? Is it possible for this situation to occur, that is, for a ``line'' somehow not to be terminated by \n?
